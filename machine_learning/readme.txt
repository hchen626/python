The lab files are from an online course. Majority the labs were prepopulated from the instructor. 

I added a couple of things to the Jupyter Notebooks to help with my learning process. 

I also add a couple more things to my final assignment.
I feel that we should have used average='weighted' when running f1_score(), but the instruction said to use 'micro' for f1_score().
