# Things that I came across on AB Testing #

I recollect what I learned from school on T-Test and F-test (Frequenist view). I recently dusted off my good old statistic textbook to find some more info Bayesian view. 

### Summary on this Topic ###
What I found on the internet is:

"In summary, the difference is that, in the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis. In the frequentist view, a hypothesis is tested without being assigned a probability."

"Update your prior distribution with the data using Bayes’ theorem (though you can have Bayesian methods without explicit use of Bayes’ rule—see non-parametric Bayesian) to obtain a posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is a probability distribution that represents your updated beliefs about the parameter after having seen the data"

### Intro to Bayesian AB testing with Will Barker ###
I wrote a Juypter notebook based on his presentation. I also added some code to graph the beta distributions, which he didn't he show in presentation. 

I still need some time to review his thoughts. .

The hypothesis testing from what I am seeing in my text book talks about whether the probability of parameter being in the null or alternative set.

I didn't feel like downgrading my python to 3.7, so I couldn't run his chainconsumer code
