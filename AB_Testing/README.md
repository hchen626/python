# Things that I came across on AB Testing #

I beleive that what I learned from school on T-Test and F-test (Frequenist view). I am still need to review my textbook on Bayesian view. 

### Different Thoughts on the Topic ###
What I found on the internet is:

"In summary, the difference is that, in the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis. In the frequentist view, a hypothesis is tested without being assigned a probability."

"Update your prior distribution with the data using Bayes’ theorem (though you can have Bayesian methods without explicit use of Bayes’ rule—see non-parametric Bayesian) to obtain a posterior distribution. The posterior distribution is a probability distribution that represents your updated beliefs about the parameter after having seen the data"

I get that as the equation of the posterior found in my textbook is this:


### Intro to Bayesian AB testing with Will Barker ###
I wrote a Juypter notebook based on his presentation. I also added some code to graph the beta distributions.

I still need some time to review his thoughts because the equation from my good old college textbook.

The hypothesis testing from what I am seeing in my text book talks about whether the probability of parameter being in the null or alternative set.
