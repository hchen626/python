# Notes

Easier tutorial than edX
- If you want quick review on python, just review my Exam worksheet notebook.
  - We use a variety of data structures
  - Go over looping

- Just a warning, the course did not cover what's immutable/alias/etc
- If you need a more in-depth python tutorial, head over to my python_basics folder
