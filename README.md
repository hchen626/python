Taking Python courses at edX 

## Additional notes
Also took courses at CFI
- The Python tutorial is quicker to go through than edX.
- Plus, the context is for finance professionals
- To answer the some questions, I added some code that I wasn't covered in the course
- I recommend reviewing my CFI labs if you don't want an in-depth Python tutorial
